# Weather ETL Pipeline

## Project Explanation
The Weather ETL Pipeline is designed to retrieve weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap API and process it to make it suitable for further analysis and visualization. The pipeline follows a series of stages, including raw data download, data harmonization, data cleansing, and data staging. The data is then transformed into SQL tables and can be used for visualization purposes.

The pipeline can be scheduled to run daily using Apache Airflow, but it is not actually scheduled in this implementation. The pipeline's primary goal is to enable users to analyze and visualize weather data using Pandas matplotlib effectively.

## Ideas for Future Improvements or Additions
- Upon successfully completing the project as described in the todo list, there are several areas for potential improvements or additions:

- Implement the Apache Airflow scheduling feature to automatically run the ETL pipeline daily and update the processed data with new forecasts.

- Expand the project to include more weather data sources or APIs, allowing for a more comprehensive and diverse dataset.

- Develop more advanced visualizations and analyses using the processed data, such as interactive plots, heatmaps, or trend analyses.

- Enhance the pipeline to handle data from multiple locations, allowing users to analyze and compare weather data across different regions.

- Implement data modeling for specific business intelligence purposes, such as predicting energy consumption based on weather data or optimizing logistics and transportation operations.

- Improve error handling and exception management in the ETL pipeline to ensure a more robust and reliable data processing workflow.
